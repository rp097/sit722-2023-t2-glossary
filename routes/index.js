GitHub allows you to host remote Git repositories, and has a wealth of community-based services that make it ideal for open source projects.', 'ref':'Vadapalli, S. 2018, DevOps: continuous delivery, integration, and deployment with DevOps: dive into the core DevOps strategies / Sricharan Vadapalli, Packt Publishing, viewed 11 July 2022'},
{'id':4, 'name':'Docker','def':'A Docker container consists of packaging the application and its dependencies all up in a box. It runs as an isolated process on the host operating system, sharing the kernel with another container. It enjoys resource isolation and allocation benefits like VMs, but is much more portable and efficient.','ref':'Vadapalli, S. 2018, DevOps: continuous delivery, integration, and deployment with DevOps: dive into the core DevOps strategies / Sricharan Vadapalli, Packt Publishing, viewed 11 July 2022'},
{'id':5, 'name':'Continuous Integration','def':'Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of quickly integrating newly developed code with the rest of the application code to be released. This saves time when the application is ready to be released. This process is usually automated and produces a build artifact at the end of the process.','ref':'Coupland, M. 2021, DevOps Adoption Strategies: Principles, Processes, Tools, and Trends / Coupland, Martyn, Packt Publishing, viewed 11 July 2022'},
{'id':6, 'name':'Continuous Deployment', 'def':'Continuous deployment is one step beyond continuous delivery. Every change that passes through all the stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There is no human intervention - a failed test, at this stage, will prevent new releases to production.', 'ref': 'Coupland, M. 2021, DevOps Adoption Strategiesâ€¯: Principles, Processes, Tools, and Trends / Coupland, Martyn, Packt Publishing, viewed 11 July 2022'},

The main objective is the satisfaction of the customer or user, measured frequently and enriched by collecting feedbacks on a regular basis.','ref':'Caseau, Yves.
